we gonna get all the efficient code in One pass not like memoization

1] Visualize the Problem In Table
2] Size the table as per Input
3] Initialize the table with default values 
    (True or False) --> For Boolean
    (0's or Numbers) --> For Continious Output
4] seed the trivial answer in table 
    (As in Fibonnaci Series --> dp[1] = 1 )
    (As in Grid Traveller --> dp[1][1] = 1)
5] Iterate through table 
6] fill further position based on current Position
