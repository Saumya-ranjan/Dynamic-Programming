#Classic Implemenation of fibonnaci series

# def func(n):
#     if n <= 2:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return func(n-2) + func(n-1)


# print(func(int(input("Input the number: "))))


# It have o(2^n) time complexity
# That really means that if we take fib(50) it goes like: 2^50
#That is roughly 1125899906842624 steps for the computer
# so this classic implementation only works for small NUmbers.
